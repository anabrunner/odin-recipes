    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a simple and easy recipe for when you are craving some tender BBQ pork ribs. If you don't have a bbq (or it's too cold to bbq outside!) then this recipe is perfect for you. All you will need is a slow cooker and an oven.</p>
    <p>Trust me, no one will know this wasn't made on an actual bbq!</p>

        <li>Rack of ribs (preferably back ribs)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper for seasoning</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Place the ribs in the slow cooker and cook on high for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer the ribs to a baking sheet and coat with BBQ sauce on both sides.</li>
        <li>Place the ribs in the oven with the broiler set on high and broil for about 5 minutes so the BBQ sauce sticks to the meat.</li>
